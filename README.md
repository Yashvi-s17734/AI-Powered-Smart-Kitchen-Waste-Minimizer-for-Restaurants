Menu Optimization – Provides AI-powered insights for optimizing restaurant menus based on available inventory.
Waste Prediction – Uses machine learning to predict potential food waste and optimize stock usage.
Inventory Estimation – While not fully automated, the system can provide semi-accurate inventory predictions.

 
Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js (Express) / FastAPI (Python for AI models)

AI/ML: TensorFlow, OpenCV, Time Series Forecasting (Prophet, ARIMA)

Database:MongoDB

Frontend: React.js

Current Limitations
Inventory tracking is not fully automated (visual detection is a work in progress).
Waste analysis is partially implemented but needs further tuning for higher accuracy.

Future Enhancements
Integrate real-time computer vision-based inventory tracking

Improve AI models for more precise waste reduction strategies

Build an interactive dashboard for real-time analytics
